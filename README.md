# yi-hack-v3

This project is a collection of config files, Makefiles and scripts to allow custom firmware images to be created and deployed to extend the functionality of Xiaomi Cameras based on HiSilicon Hi3518e V200 chipset.

Currently this project supports:
* Yi 1080p Dome
* Yi 1080p Home
* Yi Dome

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks for [GearBest](www.gearbest.com) for generously donating a Yi Dome camera so I could further develop this firmware. Without having a camera to develop on, it would not have been possible to develop past the initial firmware releases.
Consider having a look at the following special GearBest links:
* [Yi 1080p Dome](http://www.gearbest.com/ip-cameras/pp_469365.html?wid=11&lkid=10912088 "GearBest Yi 1080p Dome")
* [Yi Dome](http://www.gearbest.com/ip-cameras/pp_444029.html?wid=37&lkid=10912074 "GearBest Yi Dome")
* [Yi Home](http://www.gearbest.com/ip-cameras/pp_341365.html?wid=11&lkid=10912107 "GearBest Yi Home")

I would like to also thank the following projects for their efforts on other Xiaomi cameras and giving inspiration for me to develop and publish my own custom firmware.

## Features
The supported cameras have the following features by default:
* Wifi
* Motion detection - a video file is generated if a motion have been detected in the last 60 seconds.
* Send video/audio data through a cloud service to allow people to view camera data from their smartphone wherever they are.
* Setup through smartphone app.
* Local video storage on microSD card.

This firmware includes:
* Telnet server - _Enabled by default._
* FTP server - _Enabled by default._
* Web server - _Enabled by default._
* Proxychains-ng - _Enabled by default. Useful if the camera is region locked._

## Cameras that are Region Locked to Mainland China
This firmware includes Proxychains-ng. This allows communication between the camera and Xiaomi server to be routed through a proxy server. If Proxychains-ng is configured with a proxy server from Mainland China, the camera will no longer be region locked.

Performance is not degraded as the cameras video/audio feed is not routed through the proxy server.

## Getting Started - Step by Step Guide
1. Check that you have a correct Xiaomi Yi camera. Currently 3 cameras are supported: 
* Yi 1080p Dome Camera
* Yi 1080p Home Camera
* Yi Dome Camera

2. Get an microSD card, preferably of capacity 16gb or less and format it by selecting File System as FAT32.

**_IMPORTANT: The microSD card must be formatted in FAT32. exFAT formatted microSD cards will not work._**

3. Get the correct firmware files for your camera from this link: https://github.com/shadow-1/yi-hack-v3/releases

| Camera | rootfs partition | home partition | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Yi 1080p Dome** | rootfs_h20 | home_h20 | Firmware files required for the Yi 1080p Dome camera. |
| **Yi 1080p Home** | rootfs_y20 | home_y20 | Firmware files required for the Yi 1080p Home camera. |
| **Yi Dome** | rootfs_v201 | home_v201 | Firmware files required for the Yi Dome camera. |

4. Save both files on root path of microSD card.

**_IMPORTANT: Make sure that the filename stored on microSD card are correct and didn't get changed. e.g. The firmware filenames for the Yi 1080p Dome camera must be home_h20 and rootfs_h20._**

5. Remove power to the camera, insert the microSD card, turn the power back ON. 

6. The yellow light will come ON and flash for roughly 30 seconds, which means the firmware is being flashed successfully. The camera will boot up.

7. Install the _correct_ smartphone app onto your smartphone. Refer to [Which Smartphone App to use?](#which-smartphone-app-to-use) for guidance.

8. Configure the camera as normal by scanning the QR code on the smartphone. Ensure that your smartphone is connected to 2.4GHz wireless network.

9. Blue light should come ON indicating that your WiFi connection has been successful.

10. Although the WiFi connection on your camera has been successful but you won't be able to pair it with your phone yet until you perform the following steps.

11. Find the IP address has been assigned to your camera. This can be found on most routers. Alternatively you can install an app on your phone to scan your wifi network. Android users can install "Network Scanner" and run it to find the IP address of the camera. e.g. 192.168.1.5. The camera should be listed as “Shenzhen Zowee Technology Co. Ltd”.

12. Go in the browser and open it as a website e.g. http://192.168.1.5

13. It will open a configuration page of the camera.

14. For those with the **International Version of the Camera**. ProxyChains-ng is not required. It can be disabled by going to "System Config", select "No" against Proxy-Chains-ng and clicking "Apply". No further configuration is required.

15. For those with the **Chinese Version of the Camera**. ProxyChains-ng is required to be configured. The quickest way to configure ProxyChains-ng is to utilise the Download Proxy List feature in the firmware.

16. Click "Download Proxy List".

17. Click "Download Proxies". By default, the firmware will download a list of proxy servers and choose 10 at random. Each proxy server is automatically tested to ensure that it is operational. Each operational proxy server located within Mainland China is selected to be saved automatically.

18. Once the proxy server list has been generated and tested. Click "Save Selected Proxies". Every proxy server which has the check box next to it checked will be saved.

19. Wait 30-40 seconds and try to connect from your smartphone.
